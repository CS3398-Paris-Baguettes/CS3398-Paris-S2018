WachIt

It’s movie night and everyone has their snacks and spot in front of the television, but no one is watching the screen. That’s because after 15 minutes and 8 different providers, your favorite show is nowhere to be found! It’s been pulled from Netflix and now you must settle for a pixelated YouTube playlist of 5-minute interval clips. Well with WatchIt app, you can leave your worries at the door! Search for all your favorite media [movies, shows, music, books, etc.] and let the app tell you where it can be found! With convenience in mind the app will also bring up links for direct access. Turn on notifications and this app will tell you when your favorite media comes to your favorite platform! Go ahead and personalize your profile, and the app will even give you recommendations based on your crazy alien romance/drama addiction!
