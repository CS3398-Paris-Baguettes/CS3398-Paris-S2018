WachIt

It’s movie night and everyone has their snacks and spot in front of the television, but no one is watching the screen. That’s because after 15 minutes and 8 different providers, your favorite show is nowhere to be found! It’s been pulled from Netflix and now you must settle for a pixelated YouTube playlist of 5-minute interval clips. Well with WatchIt app, you can leave your worries at the door! Search for all your favorite media [movies, shows, music, books, etc.] and let the app tell you where it can be found! With convenience in mind the app will also bring up links for direct access. Turn on notifications and this app will tell you when your favorite media comes to your favorite platform! Go ahead and personalize your profile, and the app will even give you recommendations based on your crazy alien romance/drama addiction!

As for frontend development, our work is on time. We have devloped three out of four pages for our app. The login page, user profile page and sign up page GUIs have been completed. Homepage GUI development is in progress.

As of now, the movies are hardcoded and stored in an array until we have a web-crawler that will populate and store movies in the database. We also have a protoype of an algorithm that returns a list of movies by their provider. The purpose of this was the attempt of displaying some movies on the homepage and to create the search fragment.

The Database for storing user information is complete and needs to be implemented in the activity classes.

In addition to the application files, we have some excess file commits that are not currently implemented that need to be organized appropriately.
